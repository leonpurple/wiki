title: "Quarto Markdown: publishing"
---


## Overview
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a website hosting service that enables you to [publish content based on source code](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#ignoring-output) managed within a **GitHub repository**.

Use the `quarto publish` **command** to <mark>publish content rendered</mark> on your local machine.

`quarto publish` will make several operations with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- provision,
- create pipeline,
- create branch with HTML source
- parse .qmd to .html
- render (or build)
- deploy,
- hosting,
- publish

The most important for us will be to make a branch `gh-pages` the first time **where the output HTML will be deployed** with  `quarto publish gh-pages`.

## (0) Files On Repository

Your need to create a repository on GitHub with the Quarto pages ``.qmd`` pushed there.

**Create repository, commit and push** files to repository with <mark>Sync tool</mark>. To write our repository you need to:

1. Create Token on GitHub.com: [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
2. Use this token on your Visual Code - Git, [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git):

``` bash
$git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
$git config --global user.mail "monalisa@davinci.com"
$git config --global user.password "4WTVEG43_Q34WG435GAWER4_Q4vsrsrggr_3D44"
```

## (2) Define Ignoring Output
It’s important to note that you don’t need to check your _site or _book directory into version control (if you have done this in the past you know it makes for very messy diffs!). Before proceeding you should add the output directory of your project to .gitignore. For example:

```bash
## .gitignore

/.quarto/
/_site/
```
If you’ve already checked these files into source control you may need to remove them explicitly:

```bash
## Terminal

git rm -r _site
```

## (3) Publish on branch gh-pages
Once you have configured the source branch and updated your .gitignore, navigate to the directory where your project / git repository is located, make sure you are not on the gh-pages branch, and execute the quarto publish command for GitHub Pages:


```bash
## Terminal

quarto publish gh-pages
```

The publish command will confirm that you want to publish, render your content, copy the output to a special gh-pages branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view your site once it is deployed.

After this first time it will be no necessary to call gh-pages brach, once it has been defined as default:

```bash
##Terminal

quarto publish 
```
