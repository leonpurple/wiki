**📘 What is a Java Object**

An object in Java is a **container that holds both data and behavior**. The data is represented by the object's attributes, and the behavior is represented by the methods that operate on those attributes.

When you create an object, you are creating an **instance of a class**, which is a blueprint or template for the object.

**📘 What is a Java Class**

A Java class is a **template for creating objects, defining object data types and methods**. A class is a blueprint for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. 

In other words, a class defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from the class will have. 

<mark>For example, if you have a class called "Dog," objects created from that class might have properties like "breed" and "age," as well as behaviors like "bark" and "fetch."</mark> Classes are an important concept in object-oriented programming, and are a fundamental building block of Java programs

## Introduction

<mark>Each object has its own unique identity, and it maintains its own state by storing the values of its attributes. The object's behavior is defined by the methods that operate on its attributes, and these methods can be invoked by other code to ask the object to perform a specific action<mark>.

Objects are an essential concept in object-oriented programming, and they are used to model real-world entities in a program. For example, you could create an object to represent a particular person, with attributes such as name, age, and address, and methods that operate on these attributes, such as a method to calculate their age in a particular year.

In Java, you can create objects by using the `new` keyword and the class constructor to allocate memory for the object, and then you can access the object's attributes and methods by using the `.` (dot) operator. For example, if you have a class called `Person`, you could create an object of that class like this:

``` java
Person carla = new Person();
```

And then you could access the object's attributes and methods like this:

``` java
person.name = "Carla Whitesand";
person.setAddress("123 Main Street");
int age = person.calculateAge(2022);
```

In this example, `name` and `setAddress()` are attributes and methods of the `Person` class, and `person` is an object of that class. You can use this object to store and manipulate data according to the rules defined by the class.

## Creating Objects

[from The Java™ Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/objectcreation.html)

As you know, a class provides the blueprint for objects; you create an object from a class. Each of the following statements taken from the [``CreateObjectDemo``](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/examples/CreateObjectDemo.java) program creates an object and assigns it to a variable:

``` java
Point originOne = new Point(23, 94);
Rectangle rectOne = new Rectangle(originOne, 100, 200);
Rectangle rectTwo = new Rectangle(50, 100);
```

The first line creates an object of the ``Point`` class, and the second and third lines each create an object of the ``Rectangle`` class.

Each of these statements has three parts (discussed in detail below):

- **Declaration**: The code set in bold are all variable declarations that associate a variable name with an object type.
- **Instantiation**: The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object.
- **Initialization**: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.

## Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Object

Previously, you learned that to declare a variable, you write:

``type name;``

This notifies the compiler that you will use name to refer to data whose type is type. With a primitive variable, this declaration also reserves the proper amount of memory for the variable.

You can also declare a reference variable on its own line. For example:

``` java
Point originOne;
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Just a reference variable: is empty

If you declare ``originOne`` like this, its value will be undetermined until an object is actually created and assigned to it. Simply declaring a reference variable does not create an object.
:::

For that, you need to use the ``new`` operator, as described in the next section. **You must assign an object to ``originOne`` before you use it in your code. Otherwise, you will get a compiler error**.

A variable in this state, which currently references no object, can be illustrated as follows (the variable name, originOne, plus a reference pointing to nothing):

``originOne`` --> **null**

## Instantiating a Class

::: {.summary}

📘 **Instantiating a Class**

The ``new`` **operator instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory**. The new operator also invokes the object constructor.
:::

::: {.callout-important}

## Instantiating a class

The phrase "**instantiating a class**" means the same thing as "**creating an object.**" When you create an object, you are creating an "**instance**" of a class, therefore "**instantiating**" a class.

The ``new`` operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate.
:::

The ``new`` operator returns a reference to the object it created. This reference is usually assigned to a variable of the appropriate type, like:

``` java
Point originOne = new Point(23, 94);
```

``originOne`` --> **Point object**

!["originOne --> Point object" figure part 2](/images/javase/pointToObject-2.png)

The reference returned by the new operator does not have to be assigned to a variable. It can also be used directly in an expression. For example:

``` java
int height = new Rectangle().height;
```

This statement will be discussed in the next section or you can go [here](/javase/resources.qmd#IsJavaReference).

## Initializing an Object

Here's the code for the Point class:

``` java
public class Point {
    public int x = 0;
    public int y = 0;
    //constructor
    public Point(int a, int b) {
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
}
```


This class contains a single **constructor**. You can recognize a **constructor** because its declaration uses the s*ame name as the class and it has no return type*.

The **constructor** in the ``Point`` class takes two integer arguments, as declared by the code ``(int a, int b)``. The following statement provides ``23`` and ``94`` as values for those arguments:

``` java
Point originOne = new Point(23, 94);
```
